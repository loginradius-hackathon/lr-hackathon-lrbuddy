### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with LR, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/loginradius-hackathon/lr-hackathon-lrbuddy/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/loginradius-hackathon/lr-hackathon-lrbuddy/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/loginradius-hackathon/lr-hackathon-lrbuddy/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
